When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When Im ready to collaborate with other collegues, so we can work all on the same file and also keep up to date with the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I don't really know... I'd prefer to be automatically up-to-date because if I forget to update it manually, my repository would be old and useless.
