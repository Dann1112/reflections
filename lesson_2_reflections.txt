What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates the .git directory and creates an empty repository. I need it because it will
allow me to commit my files later using Git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area works as an intermidiate between the working directory and the repository
because it helps you decide what files you are about to commit.
